# GBC_Superstore
The datasheet is collected from the company website logs. With the help of those log files, they create the dataset above. The main purpose of the company might be to increase its profit and minimize the loss. We observe in the dataset that we have a lot of returned products, that’s a sign of high cost. The reasons for the clients returning their product might be different, maybe the product wasn't the right one with the right Id and Name, maybe they made any mistake on the shippining part, maybe they delayed the time that the product should arrive and the client just canceled the order. So there might have been many reasons. Also we see at the discount column a lot of 0s. We can assume that there is not any discount for that product. We can assume that the Sales are made in USD, as the country in this dataset is the United States. Also the question that we have observing the dataset: Which is the Country/City/State that the company gets the most profits from and who is the Country/City/State that doesn’t give a high level of profits? Which is the product that is being purchased the most?
